# toDoList
To-Do list with create and delete options
Implement a To-Do List with Javascript and Local Storage.

Steps to follow:
1. Create the HTML(Markup) and CSS(Style sheet)
2. Define the JavaScript 
3. Create Tasks and Submit to do Form:
When the to-do form is submitted, a new task is created and added to local storage, and the contents of the page are updated
4.Saving Tasks in Local Storage:
The tasks we create could be stored using a database, cookies, or a number of other technologies. However, in this application I have used HTML5â€™s local storage for its simplicity. In JavaScript, the variable localStorage stores all of this data. 
5. Deleting Tasks: Delete the todo items
